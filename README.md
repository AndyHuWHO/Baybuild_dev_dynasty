## BayBuild


Multimillion dollar modular home construction firm has requested us to build this software to track their current home construction process. 
A real modular home factory builds 25 houses a day and needs a planning and resource tracking system. This system will track homes through the 19 stages of manufacturing in 20 production bays (plumbing, electrical, drywall etc). Currently this company uses excel and whiteboards to track everything and homes are being shipped to their final destination without proper quality checks and approvals. 
Our application will store data of different user accounts with different roles and permission levels, modular homes built by the company, and production bays on the production site. Users of this application will be able to add and manage homes in the production site, track and manage the production processes of homes being built in different production bays including defect management and quality checks, and send customers current home building progress in real time.

## Project Description & Goals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Minimal requirements
- Add House -  allow users to be able to add a house (to be constructed). Each house should contain details such as house number, price, size, house model etc.

- Search For House In List and See House Details -  A user should be able to search their house number from a list via a search. When a user clicks on a house in the list of houses they will be taken to a page with details about that house.


- Modify Current House Stage -  A user should be able to modify the current house stage. Eg. A house has completed all the electrical work; they should be able to move it to the next stage which is the plumbing stage.

- View “Production Line Status Board” -  A user should be able to go to the production board and see the status of all houses on the assembly line.


### Standard Requirements


- User Account Setup -  allow administrators to create accounts with different permission levels and allow them to login and logout. 

- Create Quality Control Forms that need to be completed at Each Stage of the Assembly Line -  A user should be able to complete a Quality Control Form at each stage of the housing process. There are 19 stages so there are many stages.  

- Track House Progress with Status on “Production Line Status Board” -  A user should be able to mark “work completed” on the current stage so that a quality control person can do a quality check and move the house to the next stage

- Create And Update House Defects -  A user should be able to create defects that will be associated with the current stage the house is in. A user should be able to mark defects as fixed. Defects can have pictures attached
 
- Attach External Documents to House Record - A user should be able to attach pictures to the house document page for later reference. This can include blueprints or contract documents

- Customer Setup -  A user should be able to add, edit and delete a customer. When a house is being added, each house should be associated with one customer.


### Strech Requirements

- Drag and Drop Houses Between Stages -  A user can drag and drop houses between stages via the assembly line status board. 

- Automated Email Status Updates -  A user will receive daily update on the statuses of houses in the current assembly line

- Analytics Page - A user should be able to see the average time to complete a house per square footage.
