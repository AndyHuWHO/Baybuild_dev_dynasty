## BayBuild


Multimillion dollar modular home construction firm has requested us to build this software to track their current home construction process. 
A real modular home factory builds 25 houses a day and needs a planning and resource tracking system. This system will track homes through the 19 stages of manufacturing in 20 production bays (plumbing, electrical, drywall etc). Currently this company uses excel and whiteboards to track everything and homes are being shipped to their final destination without proper quality checks and approvals. 
Our application will store data of different user accounts with different roles and permission levels, modular homes built by the company, and production bays on the production site. Users of this application will be able to add and manage homes in the production site, track and manage the production processes of homes being built in different production bays including defect management and quality checks, and send customers current home building progress in real time.

## Project Description & Goals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Minimal requirements
- Add House -  allow users to be able to add a house (to be constructed). Each house should contain details such as house number, price, size, house model etc.

- Search For House In List and See House Details -  A user should be able to search their house number from a list via a search. When a user clicks on a house in the list of houses they will be taken to a page with details about that house.


- Modify Current House Stage -  A user should be able to modify the current house stage. Eg. A house has completed all the electrical work; they should be able to move it to the next stage which is the plumbing stage.

- View “Production Line Status Board” -  A user should be able to go to the production board and see the status of all houses on the assembly line.
