## BayBuild


Multimillion dollar modular home construction firm has requested us to build this software to track their current home construction process. Currently this company uses excel and whiteboards to track everything.
A real modular home factory builds 25 houses a day and needs a planning and resource tracking system. This system will track homes through the 19 stages of manufacturing (plumbing, electrical, drywall etc). 
Currently homes are being shipped to their final destination without proper quality checks and approvals. On top of that, if information needs to be looked up about a home after it was shipped to site an employee has to waste their time digging through a filing cabinet of spreadsheets and paper based work orders.
