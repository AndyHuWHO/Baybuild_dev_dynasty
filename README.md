## BayBuild


Multimillion dollar modular home construction firm has requested us to build this software to track their current home construction process. 
A real modular home factory builds 25 houses a day and needs a planning and resource tracking system. This system will track homes through the 19 stages of manufacturing in 20 production bays (plumbing, electrical, drywall etc). Currently this company uses excel and whiteboards to track everything and homes are being shipped to their final destination without proper quality checks and approvals. 
Our application will store data of different user accounts with different roles and permission levels, modular homes built by the company, and production bays on the production site. Users of this application will be able to add and manage homes in the production site, track and manage the production processes of homes being built in different production bays including defect management and quality checks, and send customers current home building progress in real time.
